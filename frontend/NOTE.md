### Prompt: Sprint 1 — Multi-Tenant Foundation

## User Stories

As a system admin, I can create a tenant with subscription details so that different garages have isolated data.

As a tenant owner, I can add branches to my tenant to represent different locations.

As any user, I can only view and manage data belonging to my own tenant and branch.

## Tasks

Add Tenant and Branch entities in the backend (C# .NET).

Update database schema to include tenant_id and branch_id on all relevant tables (Vehicles, Jobs, Inventory, Invoices).

Implement middleware to detect the tenant from subdomain or login credentials.

Update all API queries to filter results by tenant and branch IDs.

Create a simple UI for tenant and branch management.

## Acceptance Criteria

Each tenant’s data is completely isolated.

A tenant can have one or more branches.

Data is filtered automatically for the logged-in user’s tenant and branch.

### Phase 1: Implemention

## Backend (C# .NET)

  - Tenant & Branch Entities: Created robust domain entities with proper relationships
  - Database Schema: Added migration script with tenant_id/branch_id columns on all relevant tables
  - Tenant Context: Implemented service to track current tenant/branch throughout requests
  - Middleware: Created tenant resolution middleware that detects tenant from subdomains or JWT claims
  - Repository Pattern: Updated generic repository to automatically filter queries by tenant
  - API Controllers: Built REST endpoints for tenant and branch management
  - AutoMapper: Configured mappings for new DTOs

## Database Schema Changes

  - Added Tenant and Branch tables with proper relationships
  - Updated all domain tables (Vehicle, Client, Employee, Storage, SparePart, Work, Pricing) with TenantId and
  BranchId columns
  - Added indexes for optimal tenant filtering performance
  - Created default tenant and branch for existing data migration

## Domain Model Updates

  - Updated all major entities to inherit from TenantEntity base class
  - Modified constructors to accept tenant/branch parameters
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

## Middleware & Security

  - Tenant resolution from subdomains (e.g., tenant1.example.com)
  - Fallback to JWT claims for tenant identification
  - Automatic data isolation at repository level
  - Proper error handling and logging

## Frontend (Next.js/React)

  - Tenant Management UI: Complete CRUD interface for tenant administration
  - Branch Management UI: Full branch management with create/edit/list functionality
  - Navigation Integration: Added tenant and branch links to main navigation
  - Form Components: Reusable forms with validation and error handling

## Key Features Delivered

  ✅ Data Isolation: Each tenant's data is completely separated
  ✅ Branch Support: Tenants can have multiple branches for different locations
  ✅ Subdomain Detection: Automatic tenant resolution from URLs
  ✅ Scalable Architecture: Repository pattern with automatic filtering
  ✅ Admin Interface: Simple UI for tenant and branch management
  ✅ Migration Safety: Backward-compatible database changes

## Usage Examples

  - tenant1.example.com - automatically resolves to Tenant 1
  - API automatically filters all queries by current tenant
  - Branch-specific data can be filtered when branch context is available
  - Admin users can manage tenants and branches through the UI

  The implementation provides a solid foundation for multi-tenancy that ensures complete data isolation while
  maintaining ease of use and scalability.
