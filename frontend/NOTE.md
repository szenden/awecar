### Prompt: Sprint 1 ‚Äî Multi-Tenant Foundation

## User Stories

As a system admin, I can create a tenant with subscription details so that different garages have isolated data.

As a tenant owner, I can add branches to my tenant to represent different locations.

As any user, I can only view and manage data belonging to my own tenant and branch.

## Tasks

Add Tenant and Branch entities in the backend (C# .NET).

Update database schema to include tenant_id and branch_id on all relevant tables (Vehicles, Jobs, Inventory, Invoices).

Implement middleware to detect the tenant from subdomain or login credentials.

Update all API queries to filter results by tenant and branch IDs.

Create a simple UI for tenant and branch management.

## Acceptance Criteria

Each tenant‚Äôs data is completely isolated.

A tenant can have one or more branches.

Data is filtered automatically for the logged-in user‚Äôs tenant and branch.

### Phase 1: Implemention

## Backend (C# .NET)

  - Tenant & Branch Entities: Created robust domain entities with proper relationships
  - Database Schema: Added migration script with tenant_id/branch_id columns on all relevant tables
  - Tenant Context: Implemented service to track current tenant/branch throughout requests
  - Middleware: Created tenant resolution middleware that detects tenant from subdomains or JWT claims
  - Repository Pattern: Updated generic repository to automatically filter queries by tenant
  - API Controllers: Built REST endpoints for tenant and branch management
  - AutoMapper: Configured mappings for new DTOs

## Database Schema Changes

  - Added Tenant and Branch tables with proper relationships
  - Updated all domain tables (Vehicle, Client, Employee, Storage, SparePart, Work, Pricing) with TenantId and
  BranchId columns
  - Added indexes for optimal tenant filtering performance
  - Created default tenant and branch for existing data migration

## Domain Model Updates

  - Updated all major entities to inherit from TenantEntity base class
  - Modified constructors to accept tenant/branch parameters
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

## Middleware & Security

  - Tenant resolution from subdomains (e.g., tenant1.example.com)
  - Fallback to JWT claims for tenant identification
  - Automatic data isolation at repository level
  - Proper error handling and logging

## Frontend (Next.js/React)

  - Tenant Management UI: Complete CRUD interface for tenant administration
  - Branch Management UI: Full branch management with create/edit/list functionality
  - Navigation Integration: Added tenant and branch links to main navigation
  - Form Components: Reusable forms with validation and error handling

## Key Features Delivered

  ‚úÖ Data Isolation: Each tenant's data is completely separated
  ‚úÖ Branch Support: Tenants can have multiple branches for different locations
  ‚úÖ Subdomain Detection: Automatic tenant resolution from URLs
  ‚úÖ Scalable Architecture: Repository pattern with automatic filtering
  ‚úÖ Admin Interface: Simple UI for tenant and branch management
  ‚úÖ Migration Safety: Backward-compatible database changes

## Usage Examples

  - tenant1.example.com - automatically resolves to Tenant 1
  - API automatically filters all queries by current tenant
  - Branch-specific data can be filtered when branch context is available
  - Admin users can manage tenants and branches through the UI

  The implementation provides a solid foundation for multi-tenancy that ensures complete data isolation while
  maintaining ease of use and scalability.

üöÄ Complete Multi-Tenant Admin Workflow

  1. System Admin Login

  Default Credentials:
  - Username: admin
  - Password: admin123
  - URL: http://localhost:3000/admin

  2. Create New Tenant (Complete Process)

  As System Admin:
  1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard (/admin)
  2. Click "Create New Tenant"
  3. Fill out the comprehensive form:

  3. Tenant Details:
    - Tenant Name: "ABC Auto Repair"
    - Subdomain: "abc-auto" (auto-generated)
    - Subscription Plan: Premium/Basic/Enterprise
    - Expiration Date: Set future date

  Admin User Details:
    - First/Last Name: "John Smith"
    - Email: "john@abcauto.com"
    - Username: "john" (auto-generated from email)
    - Password: "secure123" (minimum 8 chars)

  Default Branch:
    - Branch Name: "Main Branch"
    - Address, Phone, Email (optional)
  4. Click "Create Tenant"

  3. What Happens Behind the Scenes

  ‚úÖ Database Operations:
  - Creates tenant record in main database
  - Provisions tenant-specific database schema
  - Creates default branch for the tenant
  - Sets up admin user account with proper permissions

  ‚úÖ User Account Creation:
  - Creates admin user in tenant database
  - Creates employee record linked to admin user
  - Generates secure password hash
  - Sets up proper tenant/branch context

  ‚úÖ Access Provisioning:
  - Generates login token for immediate access
  - Creates tenant-specific URL subdomain
  - Sets up proper authentication context

  4. Login to New Tenant Environment

  Option A: Direct URL Access
  URL: https://abc-auto.localhost:3000
  Login: john / secure123

  Option B: Admin Impersonation
  1. From Admin Dashboard, click "Login As" next to tenant
  2. Automatically logged in as tenant admin
  3. Full access to tenant environment

  Option C: Token-Based Access
  - Use the generated login token for API access
  - Token contains tenant/user context

  6. Example Complete Workflow

  # 1. Login as System Admin

    -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"}'

  # 2. Create New Tenant
  curl -X POST /api/admin/tenants \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" \

  7. Production Deployment Notes

  For production, you'll need to:
  - Replace localhost with your actual domain
  - Set up wildcard DNS (*.yourdomain.com)
  - Configure SSL certificates for subdomains
  - Update CORS settings for subdomain access
  - Change default admin password
  - Set up proper database connection pooling
